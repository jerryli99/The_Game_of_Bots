    <h1>blabla bla</h1>
    <p>
        <h3>Universe Names:</h3>
        1. A-normal-day: who got the target? <br>
        2. Bunny-in-the-transparent-box: Hey! This is MY Box -- pigeonhole principle + block paint gun to disguise boxes<br>
        3. Reverse: Which way? <br>
        4. Obstacle-push-me: Uhm? Dodge<br>
        5. I am nobody: But I know you <br>
        6. Lava era: Who knows what is next<br>
        7. Who-Sacrifice-First: Not me for sure<br>
        8. Second-Chance: Reincarnation<br>
        9. Make-a-wish: A fake Genie<br>

        <br>construst the world interaction logic or "game logic". <br>

        Tell me, artificial intelligence, what is intelligence?


    </p>

    Think in Value(infinite) or Interest(finite)?
    Empathy and perspective?
    Contribute and Coorperation
    <p>
        for universe#2 (addiction, lack freindships, low self-esteem), the box is like a filter. Millenials grow up with snapchat, fackbook, etc...good at putting filters. Rabits will jump 
        into the box to hide their shame...maybe. The environment is going to be interesting, but need more thoughts. Agents in the group chat can post bragging messages. They can brag about they have not hit 
        any obstacles even though they hit every obstacles. The other agents can raise suspect and then check the blockchain records. If verified,
        the braging agent will jump into the transparent box (to pretend nothing happened). Other agents will remember that and everyone will then move on.<br>

        for universe#6, lavas (fireblocks) emerge randomly (i am thinking about taking a random picture of the world to produce random numbers). Anyways, 
        ofcourse there are some safe areas, but only 1 agent can occupy on area at a time. Agents can push each other or choose to let go this sfae area for now.
        What will the conversation be? How will the 36 strategies work here?
